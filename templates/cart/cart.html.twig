            <h4>How do you contact us if your order does not arrive?</h4>
            <p>We recommend contacting the supplier first. There could be a reasonable explanation for a
                late delivery. It happens. For example, I recently bought a bathing suit online and it was
                a couple of weeks late because of a typhoon â€“ in my opinion, this is completely understandable.</p>
